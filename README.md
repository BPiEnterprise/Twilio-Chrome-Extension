This is my Chrome extension for playing with the Twilio API.
I was unhappy with the existing extensions, as they went through an AppEngine app instead of directly hiting Twilio with XMLHttpRequest.
This is a pretty early proof of concept and I'm quick to admit that I suck at Javascript, so the code isn't great yet.

TODO:

* Only supports a few API methods (create call, create SMS), add a lot more
* Add links to documentation
* Add some CSS that doesn't totally suck / UI overhaul
* Autocomplete for the fields, it sucks to type them everytime.
* Organize files, split out js/css

How to install
==============
Follow these instructions: http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html#load except replace step 1-3 with a git clone.
